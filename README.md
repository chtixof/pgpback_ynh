# pgpback_ynh : save and restore local PGP keys used by RainLoop under Yunohost #

No need to use this package anymore. It is now integrated in [https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/rainloop_ynh](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/rainloop_ynh). Kept for archive.

pgpback_ynh is packaged to be installed on a [Yunohost](https://yunohost.org) server. It has been tested with Chrome.

Rainloop saves your PGP private keys in the browser storage. This means that you will loose your private keys if you clear your browser storage (e.g., private browsing, different computer...). With pgpback, you can store your PGP private keys on the server securely. Go to http://DOMAIN.TLD/rainloop/pgpback to backup your PGP keys on the server or restore them.
